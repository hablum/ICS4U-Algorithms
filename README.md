# ICS4U-Algorithms

What did I learn?
I learned more about my Rubik's cube and learned how to solve the the side of the cube. I also learned more about algorithms.

How do I know it was an algorithm?
The process uses several steps that show you how to solve the 2x2. Algoritms outline different steps to take to do something.

What is an algorithm to me?
A series of steps we use all the time in everday life that help us do many things.
